# 🛍️ Retail Sales Data Processing with SQL

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how raw **retail sales data** can be processed, cleaned, and transformed using **SQL**.  
The final processed dataset is exported to a **CSV file** (`RetailSalesProcessedCSV.csv`) for further use in reporting, visualization, or machine learning tasks.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `data/` → Processed dataset (`RetailSalesProcessedCSV.csv`)  
- `sql/` → SQL queries used for data cleaning and transformation  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** (data cleaning, joins, aggregations, transformations)  
- **CSV** format for storing processed output 

---

## 🔑 Key Processing Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed duplicates and invalid entries  
   - Handled missing values (e.g., nulls in customer IDs or product categories)

   - Standardized date formats  
   - Converted currency and numeric fields where required  
   - Applied aggregations (e.g., total sales per product, region, or customer)  

3. **Export to CSV**  
   - Final structured dataset saved as `RetailSalesProcessedCSV.csv`
